# TO-DO webapp

A simple to-do web-app, where the user can set prerequisite tasks when adding tasks, as well as dates that the task cannot be done before. This way, the user can see everything they must do, but only see the tasks that they are able to do at any given moment. 

A task can be added to a category. Tasks are primarily on one page, but the user can filter tasks by one or more filters, or by deadline.

This is a port of my excel to-do app.
